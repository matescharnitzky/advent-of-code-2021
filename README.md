# advent-of-code-2021

This is a code repository with my solution for Advent of Code 2021: https://adventofcode.com/
1) First of all, I try to solve the problems on my own and submit a good solution
2) Then, I watch Joel Grus's livecoding YouTube video and I try to learn from it: https://www.youtube.com/c/JoelGrus
